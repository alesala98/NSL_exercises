# Numerical Simulation Laboratory

This repository contains all the exercises required for Numerical Simulation Laboratory exam. 

All the exercises are written in C++ or Python languages and need to be compiled first, except when the 
exercise itself is written on a Jupyter Notebook. Whenever you find a bash script you are strongly encouraged 
to use it, since it implements some boring and annoying operations on data and input/output files.
